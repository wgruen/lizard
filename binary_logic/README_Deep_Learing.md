There are two machines in this directory. One machine with just one neuron and another with 7 neurons.

a)
The machine with just one neuron was copied from the web and slightly modified. This simple machine is not able to classify the input of [0,0,0] properly.

Considering new situation [0 0 0] ->  [0.5]


b)
I believed that a machine with at least one hidden layer would have a better chance to classify that pattern properly. The second machine was written, based on the simple machine's code one day. It has 7 neurons, 3 for input, 3 hidden and 1 output neuron. This more complex machine is capable of classifying [0,0,0] properly.

Considering new situation [0 0 0] ->  [0.09700252]


c)
My next project may be a machine which detects a pattern in a byte stream. Similar the way sonar or radar has to  find and correlate the response/reflection in a noisy environment.
